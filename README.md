# BANKING-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

Approach:
Create a Menu in the main function and create different functions for the Menu, which will be called using switch case statements. There are four different functions-
account()- This function is used to create a new account.
transfermoney()- This function is used to transfer money to the account
checkbalance()- This function is used to check the balance in the account.
login()- This function is used to login into the account.
First, create an account of our user by calling the account() function after the creation of an account, store all the data into a file using file handling functions.
Then the user is able to transfer the amount to other users, for that transfermoney() function is called, and for checking the current balance in the account call checkbalance() function.
